                <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
                Text documents are often broken up into several sections and subsections. Each section is usually
                prefaced with a short title or heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the section it precedes.
                For instance this paragraph is preceded by the heading Heading Tags. The font of the section headings
                are usually larger and bolder than their subsection headings. This document uses headings to introduce
                topics such as HTML Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags can be used to format
                plain text so that it renders in a browser as large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different
                sizes: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest heading.

                    This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
                    vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.

                    This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
                    gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
                    browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
                    the right.

                    This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
                    tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
